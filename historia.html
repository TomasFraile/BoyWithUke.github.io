        <h3 class="h3">BoyWithUke began his music career in 2021. However, he began writing his original songs when he was in high school. Unlike major artists, he didnâ€™t use his real name as his artist name. He came with the name BoyWithUke as his artist name. The
            reason behind choosing this name was he often uses the musical instrument ukelele for producing his songs. He made his music debut with the EP Trouvaille which consisted of three songs namely Falling For You, Tired of Wanting You, and Animal
            Crackers respectively. After a few months, he released another EP named Faded. This EP had only two songs i.e., LoveSick and Loafers. In the same year, he has also released two LPs namely Melatonin Dreams and Fever Dreams respectively. While
            just setting up his music career, he used to share music covers on Tiktok. In a Tiktok, he has made of a cover his single Toxic. The single had very catchy lyrics & hence attracted millions of views in no time. Not just that, the audio has
            become a viral trend on the app. So far, more than 300k+ people have made a short video using the audio on Tiktok. The whole trend has helped his music receive so much exposure. Also, the audio spread like a wildfire & is currently used in
            Instagram Reels & YouTube Shorts too. The song remains his most streamed song with more than 250 million streams on Spotify. With quick success, he was able to sign a music deal with Republic Records. From starting the year as an individual
            to ending the year with a successful music deal, 2021 was indeed a life-changing year for him. So far in 2022, he has released only one single titled Long Drives. Also, he has made an announcement about his tour in the US and Europe (Germany,
            England, Netherlands)</h3>
